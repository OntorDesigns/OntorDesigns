👋 Hi, I’m @OntorDesigns
👀 I’m interested in UI/UX design, front-end development, and building clean, functional web experiences
🌱 I’m currently learning web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — Tailwind is my favorite tool
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on design-focused web apps, creative side projects, and UI/UX case studies

😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I turn wireframes into polished interfaces — sometimes with way too many layers in Figma 😅
